            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Place pork, garlic, peppercorns, bay leaves, soy sauce, eggs in a bowl, and marinate overnight. In a pressure cooker over medium heat, place marinated pork mixture, except the eggs, into the pot with vinegar and water. (Alternatively, combine ingredients in a large pot.) Bring to a boil then remove any scum that rises to the surface. Set aside eggs.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Close and then lock the lid. Simmer for 20 minutes. Release the pressure before unlocking the lid. (Alternatively, if using a standard pot, simmer until pork is almost tender, adding more water as needed.)</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>When pork is almost tender, place eggs in the sauce, ensuring that it s submerged. (Add more water as needed.) Bring back to a simmer and simmer for 8 minutes.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Remove eggs from the pot and peel eggs while still hot. Simmer pork until tender. Return eggs to the simmering adobo sauce and let simmer for 5 minutes to quickly season the egg in the adobo sauce. Turn off the heat and serve immediately.</p>
